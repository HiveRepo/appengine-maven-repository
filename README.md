# appengine-maven-repository

Private Maven repositories hosted on Google App-Engine, backed by Google Cloud Storage. 

# Why ?

Private Maven repositories shouldn't cost you [an arm and a leg](https://bintray.com/account/pricing?tab=account&type=pricing), nor requires you to become a [Linux SysAdmin](https://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/how-to-setup-private-maven-repository/en) to setup, and should ideally be **zero maintenance** and **cost nothing**.

Thanks to Google App-Engine's [free quotas](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas), you'll benefits for free:

* 5GB of storage
* 1GB of daily incoming bandwidth
* 1GB of daily outgoing bandwidth
* 20,000+ storage ops per day
* No maintenance

Moreover, no credit card are required to benefit of those free quotas.

# Limitations

Google App-Engine HTTP requests are limited to 32MB - and thus, any artifacts above that limit can't be hosted.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

First of all, you'll need to go to your [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create a new project:

Once your project is created be sure you activated the default Cloud Storage bucket for your app: click *Create* under *Default Cloud Storage Bucket* in the App Engine settings page for your project. 


## Configuration

Clone (or [download](https://github.com/renaudcerrato/appengine-maven-repository/archive/master.zip)) the source code:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/renaudcerrato/appengine-maven-repository.git
```

Edit [`appengine-web.xml`](src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml#L3), and replace the default application ID with the one you choosed previously:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0">
    <application>your-app-id</application>
    ...
```

Finally, update [`users.txt`](src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/users.txt) to declare users, passwords and roles:

```ini
# That file declares repositories users - using basic authentication.
# Minimal access control is provided through roles: write, read, list.
# Syntax is:
# <username>:<password>:<role>[,<role>]

admin:l33t:write,read,list
john:j123:read,list
donald:coolpw:read,list
guest:guest:list
```
> The `list` role allows you to list/browse the content of your repository, but download is prohibited. Both the `list` and `read` roles are required to be able to fetch artifacts.

## Deployment

Once you're ready to go live, just push the application to Google App-Engine:

```bash
$ cd appengine-maven-repository
$ ./gradlew appengineUpdate
```

> Please note that the very first time you'll run the commands above, a browser page will open - asking you to authorize to Gradle App-Engine plugin to access your Google Cloud account. Just copy the returned authorization code, paste it into your console and press [Enter].

And voil√†! Your private Maven repository can be accessed at the following address:

`https://<yourappid>.appspot.com`

# Artifacts

There's no special configuration required to deploy artifacts, just upload your artifacts the way you're used to do. An example using Gradle:

```gradle
apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'maven'

...

uploadArchives {
    repositories {
        mavenDeployer {
            repository(url: "https://<yourappid>.appspot.com") {
                authentication(userName: "admin", password: "password")
            }
            pom.version = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
            pom.artifactId = "test"
            pom.groupId = "com.example"
        }
    }
}
```
Using the above, deploying artifacts to your brand new private repository is as simple as:

```bash
$ ./gradlew upload
```

[Accessing artifacts](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management.html#sec:accessing_password_protected_maven_repositories) doesn't require any special configuration neither:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        credentials {
            username 'user'
            password 'password'
        }
        url "https://<yourappid>.appspot.com"
    }
}

```
